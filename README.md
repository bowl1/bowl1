## 🧩 Projects

### 🌀 Behaviour-Aware Federated Wind Power Forecasting  
**Master’s Thesis Project**  
🔗 https://github.com/bowl1/Wind-and-AI  

- Built a **distributed wind power forecasting system** across **400+ independent wind turbines**.
- Designed a **behaviour-aware auto-split clustering strategy** to hierarchically group
  heterogeneous clients using only **locally aggregated statistics**.
- Trained **cluster-specific federated LSTM models** and evaluated them against
  centralized and geographic baselines under real-world data heterogeneity.

**Tech:** Python, PyTorch, Federated Learning, LSTM, Time-Series Forecasting
